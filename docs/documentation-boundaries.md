# Documentation Boundaries

> **Status:** Canonical documentation policy
>
> **Owns:** Document purpose, source-of-truth boundaries, duplication rules, and
> cross-document reference conventions.
>
> **Related documents**
>
> - Documentation index: [`./README.md`](./README.md)
> - Agent rules: [`../AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md)
> - Documentation workflow: [`./development/documentation-workflow.md`](./development/documentation-workflow.md)
> - ADR index: [`./decisions/README.md`](./decisions/README.md)

## Purpose

Each architectural fact must have one canonical owning document. Other files may
summarize it for navigation or explain why it was chosen, but they must not
create a second independent definition.

## Ownership Matrix

| Document type | Owns | Must not own |
|---|---|---|
| Root `README.md` | Project entry point and active-stack summary | Detailed architecture rules |
| `AGENTS.md` | Executable instructions for coding agents | Product rationale or full specifications |
| `docs/README.md` | Curated documentation navigation | Architecture content |
| `architecture/overview.md` | Short current-system map | Detailed subsystem policy |
| `architecture-spec-v4.md` | System-wide runtime and boundary decisions | Full subsystem detail |
| Subsystem architecture file | Detailed rules for exactly one subsystem | Historical decision rationale |
| ADR | Context, alternatives, decision, and consequences | Complete current-state specification |
| Reference document | Analysis and conceptual background | Binding implementation rules |
| Development workflow | How documentation and implementation are maintained | Domain architecture |
| Roadmap index and subroadmaps | Sequencing, dependencies, readiness, and exit gates | Detailed architecture rules or historical rationale |

## Duplication Rules

Allowed duplication:

- a one-line stack summary in the root README;
- a short architecture summary in `overview.md`;
- the selected option inside an ADR;
- a cross-reference note.

Forbidden duplication:

- two files independently defining the same invariant;
- repeated SQL schemas that can diverge;
- multiple competing module-boundary rules;
- copying a subsystem specification into `AGENTS.md`;
- treating a reference document as an active decision without an ADR.

## Cross-Reference Convention

When one document depends on another, add a note near the top:

```md
> **Related documents**
>
> - Frontend architecture: [`./architecture/frontend.md`](./architecture/frontend.md)
```

Use a relative path from the current file. The visible link text should include
the path or an unambiguous document title.

## Updating a Decision

When a decision changes:

1. create a new ADR;
2. mark the earlier ADR as superseded;
3. update the canonical subsystem document;
4. update only summaries that mention the old selection;
5. do not copy the new detailed rule into every referring document.
